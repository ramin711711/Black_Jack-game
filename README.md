Hey there! This is my new project, called: BJack. Which basically means Black Jack.
Basically, you can play Black Jack in python. 
Player == You
Dealer == Computer
The essence of the game is to reach 21 points faster than your opponent, which in this case is the Computer.
Thanks for checking out my project! Have fun!
